# Fenix changes

## 154.0.1-r1

Upstream baseline: `FIREFOX-ANDROID_154_0_1_RELEASE`

### Branding and packaging

- Changed the Android application ID to `github.aenerv7.fenix`.
- Changed the user-facing application name to `Fenix`.
- Removed the upstream `-default` suffix from the displayed version.
- Kept Focus outside the supported build and release scope.

### Simplified Chinese localization

- Filled missing `zh-rCN` resources used by the stable Android build.
- Added localized tab-group actions and labels.
- Displayed the mobile bookmarks root as “移动收藏夹”.
- Packaged the full official Android Gecko locale set into release APKs so WebExtensions and Gecko
  UI use the selected application language instead of falling back to `en-US`.

### Passwords, personal information, and autofill

- Removed password and personal-information management entry points from the UI.
- Removed the Android autofill service and its configuration activities.
- Removed password, address, and credit-card data from the default sync scope.
- Removed related shortcuts, intents, background initialization, and settings indexing.

### Tab groups

- Kept links opened by a grouped tab in that tab group by default.
- Added context-menu actions for opening a link in the current group or creating a new group.
- Scoped group selection mode to tabs in the expanded group.
- Added group multi-select actions, including “Remove from group”.
- Restored group membership when undoing partial tab deletion.
- Restored an emptied tab group when undoing deletion of all its tabs.
- Fixed the group selection toolbar layering, navigation-bar insets, light/dark colors, dismissal,
  and empty-group behavior.
- Positioned the overflow menu above the toolbar and matched the Material dropdown direction and
  timing while keeping the toolbar stationary.

### Validation performed

- Fenix debug and release variants compile successfully.
- Relevant tab-group unit and Compose tests pass. On Windows, 193 selected JVM tests passed; the 95
  tests in `DefaultTabManagerControllerTest` require the Windows native Application Services test
  libraries that are absent from the upstream 154.0.1 artifact, as documented in
  `FENIX_DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- Debug builds were installed and visually checked with gesture and three-button navigation.
- Release APKs were locally signed and checked for package name, version, ABI, and signature.

Release APKs and signing material are intentionally not stored in this source repository.
